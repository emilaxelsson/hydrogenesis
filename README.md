# Hydrogenesis

[Hydrogen](http://hydrogen-music.org) is great for realistic drum track generation.

[OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org) has an efficient keyboard-friendly editing experience.

Did you ever wish you could combine the two? *Well, now you can!*



Basic idea
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editing:

  * Set up Hydrogen as a MIDI back end for OpenMPT (see [this guide](./doc/setup_track.md))
  * Enjoy real-time Hydrogen [playback](./doc/playback.md) while editing in OpenMPT

Rendering:

  * Once done with editing, Hydrogenesis to [convert](./doc/conversion.md) the track to a Hydrogen song
  * Use Hydrogen to generate a sound file



But why?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Q:* Why not stick to Hydrogen alone?

*A:* Because Hydrogen is not ideal for manual editing of entire songs. It takes a lot of clicking in the UI to add beats and make changes. Using the piano roll (e.g. for bass guitar) is especially cumbersome.

*Q:* Why not stick to OpenMPT alone?

*A:* Because OpenMPT does not have realistic sound generation with velocities and randomly variating samples.
